Sir Jim's decision to start the car company was motivated by his disappointment over Jaguar Land Rover's decision to stop making the Defender.

In 2020, the entrepreneur, who had campaigned for Leave in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, announced that the vehicle would be assembled in France, putting an end to hopes that it would be made at a plant in Wales.

According to the company, there are currently about 20,000 Grenadiers on the road in 50 countries around the world.

Ineos Automotive lost more than 1.4 billion euros (Â£1.1bn, $1.5bn) before tax in 2023, according to a filing with the UK registry Companies House.

Germany's economy has contracted for the past two years and with tariffs, the country ""could expect a recession for this year"" too, Joachim Nagel, the head of the Deutsche Bundesbank, told the BBC World Service in an exclusive interview.

Without tariffs, the bank forecasts the German economy will stagnate but still grow, by about 0.2%, he added.

He said ""there are only losers"" when imposing tariffs, and supported the EU's retaliatory measures against US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff on all steel imports from overseas.

Trump said that ""of course"" he would respond to the countermeasures, repeating his warning to reveal ""reciprocal"" tariffs next month on countries around the world.

""Whatever they charge us with, we're charging them,"" he said.

The threat marked a further escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets amid concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.
On Wednesday, Trump moved forward with a plan to widen US tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposing a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries.

That followed an order earlier this month that raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.

Trump has also threatened tariffs - which are taxes applied to goods as they enter a country - on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars.

Leaders in Canada and Europe called the new metals taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products.

Other countries that are key US suppliers of metals, including the UK, Australia, Mexico and Brazil, held off on any immediate retaliation.

""Like everybody else, I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium but we will take a pragmatic approach,"" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

""We are...negotiating a deal which covers and includes tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table.""

It took less than 10 minutes for the European Union to respond.

""Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The EU's initial countermeasures will take effect on US products on 1 April, ranging from jeans and motorbikes to peanut butter and bourbon, just as they were with the Trump administration's first tariffs in 2018 and 2020.
But there will be more to come in mid-April. A whole swathe of textiles, home appliances, food and agricultural products could be included, depending on a two-week consultation with stakeholders.

A list of items almost 100 pages long is being circulated that features meat, dairy, fruit, wine and spirits, toilet seats, wood, coats, swimwear, nightdresses, shoes, chandeliers and lawnmowers.

For consumers, higher prices loom on Europe's supermarket shelves, especially for American products. But for businesses and some industries, especially steel, there is real danger.

The head of Germany's BGA federation of wholesale, foreign trade and service, Dirk Jandura, warned that Germans might have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for American products in the supermarkets.

Orange juice, bourbon and peanut butter were the most likely products to be hit. ""Margins in trade are so low that this cannot be absorbed by the companies,"" he said.

In total, the EU will target â¬26bn (Â£22bn) of US exports.

The EU, facing the same tariffs, said on Wednesday it would impose counter-tariffs on â¬26bn (Â£22bn) of US goods, and Canada also responded with countermeasures, in an escalation of the wider trade war.

Sir Keir said the UK was taking a ""pragmatic"" approach and was pushing for a trade deal, but opposition politicians called for a more ""robust"" response.
When Sir Keir visited the White House last month, trade was high on the agenda, with the PM seeking a trade deal and exemptions to Trump's tariffs.

Asked at the time if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said ""he tried"", adding: ""He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.""

It is understood tariffs were also discussed during a phone call between Sir Keir and Trump on Monday.

However, as the latest tariffs came into effect, there were no exemptions for any country.

European Union (EU) President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's retaliatory tariffs were ""strong but proportionate"" and that the EU remains ""open to negotiations"".

The EU tariffs will be imposed on ""products ranging from boats to bourbon to motorbikes,"" the EU said. They will be partially introduced on 1 April and fully in place on 13 April.

The prime minister said the move would free up money for front-line services.
The government said it expected around 50% of the jobs at NHS England, which as of December had 14,400 staff, and the Department of Health, which has 3,500 staff, to go.
In a speech in Hull, Sir Keir said for too long politicians had ""chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos"" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.
The government said work would begin immediately to return many of NHS England's current functions to the Department of Health and Social Care, with the aim of completing the process in two years.
The significant move gives the government more control and accountability over one of their key pledges - to cut NHS waiting times.
NHS England - which the government dubbed ""the world's largest quango"" - oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services.
It was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, with the aim of freeing the organisation from interference by politicians.

The Office for Value for Money (OVfM), which has 15 members of staff and reports directly to the chancellor, was launched in October.
But a Treasury response to a BBC Freedom of Information request revealed that as of last month the team had not started scrutinising any investment proposals.
Government documents released on Tuesday showed the first two areas it will investigate are government spending on short-term accommodation and multi-billion pound so-called ""mega projects"" such as HS2.
The OVfM is aiming to cut departmental spending by Â£4bn annually starting this year.
Labour previously said the ""hit team"" would ensure that ""every penny of taxpayers' money is spent wisely"".
Concerns have been raised by both Conservative and Labour ministers in recent years about how much public money goes on short-term accommodation costs.
The Treasury says the Home Office spent Â£2.3bn on hotels for asylum seekers in 2022-23.
Further government money was spent on accommodation for veterans, care leavers, survivors of domestic abuse, victims of modern slavery and those fleeing war.
The Institute for Public Policy Research think tank reported in 2024 that per asylum seeker, costs had increased by 141% to Â£41,000 last year - up from Â£17,000 in 2019-20.
Some in government question whether departments signing separate accommodation contracts get the best value.

In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos, and he took aim at a ""cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people"".
But the key announcement was the abolition of the ""world's largest quango"", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.
He announced the government was bringing its functions back into the Department of Health.
Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?
Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them ""arm's length bodies"". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.
They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.
The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.
Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the ""bonfire of the quangos"" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.
Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.
These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.
Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another ""bonfire of the quangos"", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more ""active and agile state"", rather than ""outsourcing"" decisions to other bodies.

The clause had been heralded by the bill's supporters as a safeguard that made it the strictest such legislation in the world.

Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who is bringing the bill, suggested replacing the role of High Court judges with a three-person panel featuring a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker to review applications.
The committee is expected to insert those details at a later stage.
After the bill committee voted 15 to seven in favour of dropping the High Court judge's role, Leadbeater said the change would make the law ""even more robust"".

The 35-year-old has been ruled out until the end of July, roughly around when the five-Test series against India is due to finish.

It means the next time Wood could play Test cricket is on the Ashes tour of Australia in November.

The injury to the Durham man is a huge blow to England in a year of two marquee Test series.

Head coach Brendon McCullum and Test captain Ben Stokes have a fondness for high pace and have now lost their fastest bowler for the home summer, with questions over whether Wood can return to face Australia.

With Wood arguably England's first-choice seamer in Test cricket, this injury casts further doubt on the wisdom of playing him at the Champions Trophy.

Jofra Archer has not played Test cricket since 2021 and is working his way back to full fitness in white-ball cricket, while Brydon Carse suffered foot problems at the Champions Trophy that subsequently ruled him out of the Indian Premier League. Josh Tongue is only just returning from a lay-off of well over a year.

An England statement said Wood had been ""managing an ongoing issue"" for more than a year, but he ""experienced increased stiffness and discomfort"" during the Champions Trophy.

Wood struggled with the injury during the defeat by Afghanistan, then missed the final game against South Africa.

The Champions Trophy and tour of India that preceded it was Wood's return from an elbow injury that had kept him out of action since August of last year.

""I'm gutted to be out for so long after representing England across all formats since the start of last year,"" said Wood. ""But I've got every confidence that I'll be back firing on all cylinders now that I've been able to sort my knee out.

The game involves players walking around in the real world to hunt the collectable creatures, which appear on their phone screens using augmented reality.
Despite launching almost a decade ago, PokÃ©mon Go is still amongst the highest-grossing mobile games in the world, with 30 million monthly players.
The deal marks the latest step by Saudi Arabia to develop its gaming industry, which it has spent billions of pounds on in recent years.
Niantic's other games, such as Monster Hunter Now and Pikmin Bloom, are also included in the acquisition, along with the people employed to make them.

Scopely is one of the biggest names in mobile gaming, with its most successful title, Monopoly Go, being downloaded more than 50 million times and generating more than $3bn in revenue.
PokÃ©mon itself is jointly owned by Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures, which licensed the brand to Niantic so it could develop the game.
Ed Wu, who leads the PokÃ©mon Go team at Niantic, said in a blog post he believed the move was ""a positive step"" for the game's future.

Its PIF has stakes in some of the biggest publishers in the industry, such as Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive.
It has also made waves in the eSports industry, with Saudi Arabia hosting major tournaments including last year's eSports World Cup, which had a prize pool of over $60m.
Riyadh will also host 2027's planned Olympic eSports Games.
Saudi Arabia's PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, which it has been investing heavily in sports such as golf, boxing and football, including a purchase of Newcastle United in a Â£300m deal in 2021.

Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.
The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.
But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.
Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.
""US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,"" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.
""It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.""
Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (Â£112bn) in 2023, according to official data.

Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.

The WX Games Weekend offers gaming fans a chance to play on a range of modern and retro games consoles as well as to attend workshops for those keen to work in the industry.
It is taking place at the Wakefield Exchange, which opened at the former market hall on Union Street in February.
Hannah Appleyard, Wakefield Council's cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport, said the event would be ""highlighting the many opportunities there are in the city and region to work in games and the creative industries"".
The free event has been organised by Wakefield Council working alongside Game Republic, which is a northern-based games industry network.
Jamie Sefton, managing director of Game Republic, said the event was suitable for all ages, ""whether you want a job in games or would just like to play games for the weekend from retro classics to VR games"".
He said that over 40 independent games companies based across Yorkshire and the north of England would be showcasing their new games at the event ahead of their official release.
Organisers said the event would also feature e-sports challenges, talks from people in the gaming industry and skills support from Wakefield College.
Topics covered at the free workshops include how to design games and designing a gaming character.
The WX Exchange has previously hosted Game Republic's GaMaYo event for gaming developers based in Yorkshire and the north of England.
