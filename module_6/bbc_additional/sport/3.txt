Fact To File put in a bold display to win the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival.

The 6-4 favourite, ridden by Mark Walsh for trainer Willie Mullins and owner JP McManus, comfortably saw off his eight rivals.

Once favourite for Friday's Gold Cup, Fact To File was instead sent to the shorter Ryanair and won by nine lengths from Heart Wood, with Envoi Allen in third.

"That was brilliant. That sort of distance suits him. He never missed a beat," said Walsh.

"Even coming up the hill, he heard the crowd and pricked his ears - he had loads left."
