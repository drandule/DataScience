Julian Alvarez slipped as he struck the penalty, but the ball flew into the top-left corner.

It looked like it was 2-2 in the Champions League last-16 shootout between derby rivals Atletico and Real Madrid.

What happened next was another one of those fine-margin VAR calls - but for a very unusual reason.

On review, Atletico's Alvarez was judged to have touched the ball twice.

That is against the rules so it was chalked off - with no option for a retake.

Real then went 3-1 ahead before winning the shootout 4-2. All the talk afterward was about that decision.
