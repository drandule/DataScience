Lewis Hamilton says he does not feel any pressure to prove himself as he starts his Ferrari career at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.

The seven-time champion left Mercedes after 12 seasons in which they became the most successful team-driver combination in Formula 1 history.

The 40-year-old Briton won six of his drivers' titles between 2014 and 2020 but has won only two races since the start of the 2022 season.

Hamilton said in Melbourne: "I am under no assumptions it will be easy. I don't feel the pressure. The outside pressure is non-existent for me. The pressure is from within and what I want to achieve.

"I am not here to prove anything to anybody. I have done it time and time again. I know what it takes to do a good job and that's what I want to deliver, for myself, and my family, for this team that I really believe deserve success.

"They are so driven and maybe they have not had as much success as they would like and deserve. Just want to work towards and contribute to doing it."
