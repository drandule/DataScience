Scotland's former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to stand down as an MSP, she has announced.
The ex-SNP leader confirmed she would not seek re-election at the Holyrood election in May next year.
After announcing her decision on social media, she told BBC Scotland News her time in parliament had been a "privilege beyond words".
She added: "But the time is right for me at this stage in my life to close the book on that chapter and open a new one."
Sturgeon resigned as first minister in March 2023 after eight years in the role.
She is Scotland's longest-serving first minister and the first woman to hold the position.
Her resignation as party leader marked the beginning of a tumultuous period for her and the SNP.
In June 2023 she was arrested and released without charge as part of a police investigation into SNP finances. She insists she has done nothing wrong.
Her husband Peter Murrell, who had long served as the SNP's chief executive, has since been charged with embezzling SNP funds.
In January, Sturgeon announced that the pair had decided to end their marriage.
The Glasgow Southside MSP is one of the original MSPs elected in 1999.
