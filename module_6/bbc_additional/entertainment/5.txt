From wedding videos to four Oscars: Anora director speaks to the BBC

Sean Baker said he was "over the moon" at the Vanity Fair party following his Oscar wins.

As the first person to win four Oscars for one film, including Best Director, Baker is the man of the moment.

He showered praise on Mikey Madison, the star of the film, who took home the Best Actress award, beating other front-runner Demi Moore.

"Mikey's win is so important to me. It's something that I was really hoping for," he says. "I'm so happy that the industry and the academy are recognising her incredible talent."
