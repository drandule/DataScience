Claims against actor Nicolas Cage have been dismissed from a civil lawsuit that was recently filed by his ex-girlfriend over an alleged assault by their son.

Christina Fulton sued 34-year-old Weston Cage for assault and battery last month, and accused Cage of negligence, claiming the star had failed to prevent their son's alleged behaviour.

However, the claims against the Oscar winner have now been removed from the lawsuit, according to US media.

When the action was filed in February, the actor's lawyers called them "frivolous", saying: "Mr Cage does not control Weston's behaviour in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother."
