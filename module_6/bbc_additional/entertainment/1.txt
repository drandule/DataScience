The wedding scene from the Gavin and Stacey finale, Strictly winner Chris McCausland's blackout dance and the moment Polin (aka Penelope and Colin) got together in Bridgerton have been named among the best TV moments of 2024 by the Bafta Awards.

They are three of the six small-screen highlights to have been nominated for the "memorable moment" prize at this year's Bafta TV Awards.

The others are naked tennis in Jilly Cooper's Rivals; Diane revealing Ross is her son on The Traitors; and a subpostmistress getting a shock about her predicament in Mr Bates vs the Post Office.

The memorable moment is the only Bafta TV Award to have its winner chosen by members of the public, and the vote is open until 25 April.
Hilary Rosen, chair of Bafta's television committee, said: "The list includes heart-warming and heart-stopping surprises that got us all talking, and speaks to the power of great television to have real and lasting impact."
