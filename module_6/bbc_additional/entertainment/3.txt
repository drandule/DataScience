James Finlayson failed to make it as a leading man in Hollywood but became one of the most memorable comic foils ever to grace the silver screen.

The Scottish actor performed in more than 100 films but was best known for being the "third man" to Laurel and Hardy.

With his distinctive fake moustache, he starred with the iconic duo in 33 of their films and later became the inspiration for Homer Simpson's "D'oh!" catchphrase.

Now Finlayson has been memorialised with a new portrait in the Scottish theatre where he first trod the boards more than a century ago. 
Dobbie Hall in his hometown of Larbert, Stirling, commissioned the oil painting to celebrate the actor's career and rise to international fame in the early days of cinema.

The portrait by young artist Connor Draycott was unveiled by Finlayson's family.

They were joined by fans of the black and white movies and "talkies" from the UK chapters of Sons of the Desert, named after the fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film of the same name.
