Launched in 2022, the Grenadier was the first vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive. It is inspired by the iconic Land Rover Defender.

Sir Jim's decision to start the car company was motivated by his disappointment over Jaguar Land Rover's decision to stop making the Defender.

In 2020, the entrepreneur, who had campaigned for Leave in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, announced that the vehicle would be assembled in France, putting an end to hopes that it would be made at a plant in Wales.

According to the company, there are currently about 20,000 Grenadiers on the road in 50 countries around the world.

Ineos Automotive lost more than 1.4 billion euros (Â£1.1bn, $1.5bn) before tax in 2023, according to a filing with the UK registry Companies House.

Sir Jim, who is one of the UK's richest people, owns a 27.7% stake in Manchester United.
