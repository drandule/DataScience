Tariffs on goods being imported into the US could tip Europe's largest economy into another recession, according to the president of Germany's central bank.

Germany's economy has contracted for the past two years and with tariffs, the country "could expect a recession for this year" too, Joachim Nagel, the head of the Deutsche Bundesbank, told the BBC World Service in an exclusive interview.

Without tariffs, the bank forecasts the German economy will stagnate but still grow, by about 0.2%, he added.

He said "there are only losers" when imposing tariffs, and supported the EU's retaliatory measures against US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff on all steel imports from overseas.
