Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will "keep all options on the table" as US President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium take effect.

The UK exports hundreds of millions of pounds worth of steel to the US every year, which will be subject to the 25% levy.

The EU, facing the same tariffs, said on Wednesday it would impose counter-tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods, and Canada also responded with countermeasures, in an escalation of the wider trade war.

Sir Keir said the UK was taking a "pragmatic" approach and was pushing for a trade deal, but opposition politicians called for a more "robust" response.
When Sir Keir visited the White House last month, trade was high on the agenda, with the PM seeking a trade deal and exemptions to Trump's tariffs.

Asked at the time if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said "he tried", adding: "He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there."

It is understood tariffs were also discussed during a phone call between Sir Keir and Trump on Monday.

However, as the latest tariffs came into effect, there were no exemptions for any country.

European Union (EU) President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's retaliatory tariffs were "strong but proportionate" and that the EU remains "open to negotiations".

The EU tariffs will be imposed on "products ranging from boats to bourbon to motorbikes," the EU said. They will be partially introduced on 1 April and fully in place on 13 April.
