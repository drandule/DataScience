A Nasa-SpaceX mission that aimed to clear the way for two "stranded" astronauts to get back to Earth has been postponed.
The Falcon 9 launch from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was put back due to a hydraulic ground issue. The next possible launch opportunity is on Friday evening.
The rocket aimed to fly four new crew members to the International Space Station (ISS) and pave the way for the return of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.
The two Nasa astronauts flew to space in June but were not able to return on a Boeing spacecraft after it was deemed unsafe. The pair should be able to return to Earth within days of the SpaceX mission reaching the ISS.
The Nasa astronauts left earth on 5 June 2024 for an eight-day mission and have been stuck at the ISS for more than nine months, instead helping ongoing missions at the station with maintenance and experiments.
The Wednesday launch would have made it possible for them to return to Earth as early as Sunday.
SpaceX said the issue that forced the launch to scrub related to the hydraulics on one of the clamp arms, which engineers were trying to fix. There were concerns the arm would not have been able to open fully during launch.
The company said the next launch window would be at 1903 Eastern Time (2303GMT) on Friday.
