A two-day gaming event featuring consoles developed by independent firms from across Yorkshire is taking place in Wakefield this weekend.
The WX Games Weekend offers gaming fans a chance to play on a range of modern and retro games consoles as well as to attend workshops for those keen to work in the industry.
It is taking place at the Wakefield Exchange, which opened at the former market hall on Union Street in February.
Hannah Appleyard, Wakefield Council's cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport, said the event would be "highlighting the many opportunities there are in the city and region to work in games and the creative industries".
The free event has been organised by Wakefield Council working alongside Game Republic, which is a northern-based games industry network.
Jamie Sefton, managing director of Game Republic, said the event was suitable for all ages, "whether you want a job in games or would just like to play games for the weekend from retro classics to VR games".
He said that over 40 independent games companies based across Yorkshire and the north of England would be showcasing their new games at the event ahead of their official release.
Organisers said the event would also feature e-sports challenges, talks from people in the gaming industry and skills support from Wakefield College.
Topics covered at the free workshops include how to design games and designing a gaming character.
The WX Exchange has previously hosted Game Republic's GaMaYo event for gaming developers based in Yorkshire and the north of England.
